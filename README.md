## SDV-GAN
## 3D Ultrasound Biomicroscopy (3D-UBM) Image Enhancement using Spatially varying Deconvolution GAN (SDV-GAN)

This project focuses on enhancing 3D Ultrasound Biomicroscopy (UBM) images using a custom Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture equipped with residual blocks and attention gates.

### Overview

Ultrasound Biomicroscopy (UBM) is a non-invasive imaging technique used for high-resolution imaging of the eye's anterior segment. However, UBM images often suffer from blurring due to varying point-spread-function of ultrasound systems. This project aims to enhance the quality of UBM images using deep learning techniques.

### Features

- **SDV-GAN Architecture**: Utilizes the Pix2Pix architecture, which learns a mapping from an input image (noisy UBM image) to an output image (enhanced UBM image).
- **Residual Blocks**: Integrates residual blocks into the generator model to facilitate better gradient flow and faster convergence during training.
- **Attention Gates**: Incorporates attention gates into the decoder blocks of the generator to selectively focus on relevant image features, improving the quality of the generated images.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Provides scripts for training the model using UBM image datasets and evaluating the performance using evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Multi-Scale SSIM (MS-SSIM).
- **Visualization**: Generates plots showcasing the model's performance over training epochs and saves the best-performing model for future use.

### Python Files

- **deconv_GAN_train_XXX.py**: Script for training the SDV-GAN model under various network conditions using UBM image datasets.
- **deconv_GAN_test_XXX.py**: Script for evaluating the trained model on a separate validation dataset and computing evaluation metrics.
- **evaluation.ipynb**: Contains functions for evaluating the model performance on test set.

### Usage

1. **Training**: Run `deconv_GAN_train_XXX.py` script to train the SDV-GAN model using the provided UBM image dataset. The code asssumes dataset and saved models are stored in a specific directory. Please check code for details.
    ```bash
    python deconv_GAN_train_XXX.py
    ```
2. **Testing**: Run `test.py` script to evaluate the trained model on a separate validation dataset and compute evaluation metrics.
    ```bash
    python deconv_GAN_test_XXX.py
    ```

### Dependencies

- Python 3.9.18
- TensorFlow 2.6
- NumPy
- scikit-image
- Matplotlib

### Dataset

The UBM image dataset used for training and validation should be organized in a structured format where each image is paired with its corresponding enhanced version. Please see the files in our lab server.
