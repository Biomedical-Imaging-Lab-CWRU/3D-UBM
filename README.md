## SDV-GAN
## 3D Ultrasound Biomicroscopy (3D-UBM) Image Enhancement using Spatially varying Deconvolution GAN (SDV-GAN)

This project focuses on enhancing 3D Ultrasound Biomicroscopy (UBM) images using a custom Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture equipped with residual blocks and attention gates.

### Overview

Ultrasound Biomicroscopy (UBM) is a non-invasive imaging technique used for high-resolution imaging of the eye's anterior segment. However, UBM images often suffer from blurring due to varying point-spread-function of ultrasound systems. This project aims to enhance the quality of UBM images using deep learning techniques.

### Features

- **SDV-GAN Architecture**: Utilizes the Pix2Pix architecture, which learns a mapping from an input image (noisy UBM image) to an output image (enhanced UBM image).
- **Residual Blocks**: Integrates residual blocks into the generator model to facilitate better gradient flow and faster convergence during training.
- **Attention Gates**: Incorporates attention gates into the decoder blocks of the generator to selectively focus on relevant image features, improving the quality of the generated images.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Provides scripts for training the model using UBM image datasets and evaluating the performance using evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Multi-Scale SSIM (MS-SSIM).
- **Visualization**: Generates plots showcasing the model's performance over training epochs and saves the best-performing model for future use.

### Python Files

- **deconv_GAN_train_XXX.py**: Script for training the SDV-GAN model under various network conditions using UBM image datasets.
- **deconv_GAN_test_XXX.py**: Script for evaluating the trained model on a separate validation dataset and computing evaluation metrics.
- **evaluation.ipynb**: Contains functions for evaluating the model performance on test set.

### Usage

1. **Training**: Run `deconv_GAN_train_XXX.py` script to train the SDV-GAN model using the provided UBM image dataset. The code asssumes dataset and saved models are stored in a specific directory. Please check code for details.
    ```bash
    python deconv_GAN_train_XXX.py
    ```
2. **Testing**: Run `deconv_GAN_test_XXX.py` script to evaluate the trained model on a separate validation dataset and compute evaluation metrics.
    ```bash
    python deconv_GAN_test_XXX.py
    ```

### Dependencies

- Python 3.9.18
- TensorFlow 2.6
- NumPy
- scikit-image
- Matplotlib

### Dataset

The UBM image dataset used for training and validation should be organized in a structured format where each image is paired with its corresponding enhanced version. Please see the files in our lab server.

## Ciliary Body Segmentation

### Overview:
The MATLAB scripts provided in this folder are designed for training and evaluating semantic segmentation models using the DeepLabv3+ architecture. These scripts are intended for binary and multi-class segmentation tasks on 3D-UBM images. Please read the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1167/tvst.11.10.3) first.

### List of Scripts:
1. `deeplab_cb_2_class_XXX_YYY_ZZZ.m`: This script trains a DeepLabv3+ model for binary semantic segmentation on 3D-UBM images, segmenting images into two classes: "CB" (ciliary body) and "background". XXX indicates enface or radial. YYY indicates 2D or 2.5D. ZZZ indicates dice loss or cross-entropy loss.
   
2. `deeplab_cb_3_class_XXX_YYY_ZZZ.m`: This script trains a DeepLabv3+ model for multi-class semantic segmentation on medical images, segmenting images into three classes: "CB" (ciliary muscle), "CP" (ciliary processes), and "background".

3. `evaluation_2_class_*.m` and `evaluation_3_class_*.m`: This script evaluates the performance of the trained segmentation models. It computes various performance metrics such as Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, Precision, and F1-score on a per-volume basis.

## Usage:
1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Organize your image and ground truth (GT) data into appropriate directories.
   - Ensure that images and GT data are correctly named and correspond to each other.

2. **Training:**
   - Update the directories for images and GT data in the training scripts (`deeplab_cb_2_class_*.m` and `deeplab_cb_3_class_*.m`).
   - Customize the network architecture, training options, and parameters as needed.
   - Execute the training scripts in MATLAB environment.

3. **Evaluation:**
   - Update the directories for images, GT data, and segmentation results in the evaluation script (`evaluation_*.m`).
   - Run the evaluation script to compute performance metrics for the trained models.

## Additional Notes:
- Ensure that necessary MATLAB toolboxes (e.g., Image Processing Toolbox, Deep Learning Toolbox) are installed and configured.
- GPU support is utilized for faster training; make sure a compatible GPU and CUDA toolkit are available.
- Adjust paths, network architecture, and training parameters according to your dataset and requirements.
- Customize evaluation metrics or add additional evaluation methods as needed.

## Example Workflow:
1. Train the desired segmentation model using `deeplab_cb_2_class.m` or `deeplab_cb_3_class.m`.
2. Evaluate the trained model using `evaluation_2_class_enface.m` or `evaluation_3_class_enface.m`.
3. Visualize results of all files using `visualization_images*.m`

## Acknowledgements:
These scripts leverage MATLAB's Image Processing Toolbox and Deep Learning Toolbox for image processing and deep learning tasks. The DeepLabv3+ architecture is implemented using MATLAB's built-in functions. The code also requires [natsortfiles](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47434-natural-order-filename-sort) toolbox for natural sorting.
